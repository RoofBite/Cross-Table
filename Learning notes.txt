Learned
1. To redirect with arguments use:

kwargs = {'x': x,'y':y}
        
	return redirect( 'CrossTable:setup1',**kwargs)

2. Difference between request.POST.get('roofbite') and request.POST('roofbite')

request.POST('roofbite') will raise a KeyError exception if 'roofbite' is not in request.POST.
request.POST.get('roofbite') will return None

request.POST.get has also default option:
request.POST.get('roofbite','lack of roofbite')



Debuging

1. Don't mix *args and **kwargs in call to reverse()!
 Error occured when I've passed request in return reverse()

2. Html form was not sending data
I've closed <form> tag too early in code
got error CSRF verification failed. Request aborted. (Forbidden (403)) DJANGO

3.  request.POST.get should heve () not {}
Proper: request.POST.get('questions_number')
